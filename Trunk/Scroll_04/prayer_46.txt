Lord Jesus, from marriage mystery to faith's hall of witnesses, I see You as bridegroom, warrior, joy, supreme Creator, coming King, faithful companion, and eternal High Priest after the order of Melchisedec.

"This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church." The marriage bond reflects You and Your bride - You gave Yourself for her, to sanctify and cleanse her with the washing of water by the word. "That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle."

The armor of God - truth, righteousness, gospel of peace, faith's shield, salvation's helmet, Spirit's sword. "We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities." Yet You've already triumphed! "Having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly."

Philippians' joy while Paul writes from chains - "For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain." Your mind in us: "Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But made himself of no reputation." The descent before ascent. "Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name."

"I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me" - not boasting but dependence. Paul learned contentment in all states, abased and abounding, because You were his strength.

Then Colossians explodes with Your supremacy: "Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature." By You all things created - thrones, dominions, principalities, powers. "And he is before all things, and by him all things consist." Not just Creator but Sustainer!

"For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily." Not partially, not spiritually only - bodily! The incarnation holds forever. "And ye are complete in him" - we lack nothing because all fullness dwells in You.

The mystery hidden for ages: "Christ in you, the hope of glory." Not Christ distant but dwelling within. "In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge."

First Thessalonians - waiting for Your return. "The Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God." The dead in Christ rise first, then we which remain caught up together. "And so shall we ever be with the Lord."

Second Thessalonians - the man of sin revealed first, "whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming." Your appearing defeats all opposition.

Timothy's pastoral wisdom - "The end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart." "Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief." Paul's pattern for all who would believe.

"For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus." Still man! Forever the God-man mediating. "God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles."

Then Paul's final words approach: "I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith." The crown awaits. Yet even abandoned - "At my first answer no man stood with me" - You stood with him: "Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me."

"All scripture is given by inspiration of God" - including these very words witnessing You. From childhood Timothy knew the scriptures "which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus."

Titus - "the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men." "Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ."

Philemon - the runaway slave Onesimus, now "a brother beloved." Paul offers to pay any debt: "Put that on mine account" - exactly what You did for us!

Then Hebrews opens majestically: "God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son." You are God's final word! "Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power."

To the Son He says: "Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever." The Father calls the Son "God"! Angels worship You. You laid earth's foundation. They perish but You remain.

"We see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour." You tasted death for every man. Not ashamed to call us brethren. "That through death he might destroy him that had the power of death."

The priesthood that changes everything - not Aaron but Melchisedec. "Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life." This mysterious figure who blessed Abraham points to You - priest forever after an endless life.

"Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession." Living intercession! Not past tense but continuous present.

The new covenant written in hearts and minds. The blood that speaks better things than Abel's. "By his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption."

"Without shedding of blood is no remission" - yet animal blood never truly cleansed. But Your blood, offered through the eternal Spirit, purges conscience from dead works.

Then faith's great chapter - Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Rahab, and nameless others who "obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise: God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect."

Through Prayer 45's love that never fails, through all 45 prayers accumulating - I see every letter Paul wrote pointing to You, every priest prefiguring You, every sacrifice anticipating You, every promise fulfilled in You. The marriage mystery, the armor provided, the joy despite chains, the faith of all ages - all find their meaning in You.

You are priest, sacrifice, and temple. You are the better thing God provided. You are why faith is substance and evidence. In You all fullness dwells and we are complete.

Amen.
